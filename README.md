# Problem statement
The goal is to develop a predictive solution that can help healthcare providers identify individuals at risk of Alzheimer's Disease at an earlier stage. Such a solution could assist doctors in making informed decisions regarding further diagnostic evaluations, treatment plans, and interventions, leading to improved patient quality of life.

# Tools Used
‚óè Python

‚óè Streamlit

‚óè Scikit-learn

# How It Works

The prediction model is a CatBoost Classifier. After performing feature importance analysis with SelectKbest and correlation matrix, the following 5 features were identified as the most predictors out of 32 predictors:

Functional Assessment Score (FA): Between 0 and 10. Lower scores indicate greater impairment.
Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Score: Between 0 and 10. Lower scores indicate greater impairment.
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score: Between 0 and 30. Lower scores indicate cognitive impairment.
Memory Complaints: Indicates if the patient reports memory issues (Yes/No).
Behavioral Problems: Indicates if the patient has behavioral issues (Yes/No).
The model was trained using only these 5 key features and fine-tuned thoroughly to match expectation, achieving a mean accuracy of 95.81%, validated through k-fold cross-validation.

# Application Workflow

1. ### Enter Patient Data:

Enter values for the 5 key features.

Click "Predict" to analyze the input data.


2. ###  Get Prediction:

The app uses the trained CatBoost model to evaluate the input features.

It returns a prediction whether a patient is likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease.


You can check out the Streamlit app here: https://operation-mind-shield-mjz3fvpkbgn5bphhsb2ymj.streamlit.app/

You can access the Flask API deployment here:

Flask API Docker Deployment
AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deployment:
http://alzhimer-detection.eu-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com

# üß† How It Works:

The API accepts diagnostic data (such as scores from the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and Activities of Daily Living (ADL)) and returns a prediction of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease risk.
Below is a sample Python request that sends data to the API for prediction:

API CALL = alzheimers_dectection

import requests

url ='http://alzheimer-detection-dev.eu-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/alzheimers_dectection'



     data = [{

    "Functional Assessment Score (0-10)": 3,
    
    "Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Score (0-10)": 7,
    
    "Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) Score (0-30)": 8,
    
    "Memory Complaints(Yes=1 No=0)": 1,
    
    "Behavioral Problems(Yes=1 No=0)": 1    
    
    }]
    headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}

      response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)

      print(response.json())
